"Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction","Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP) is a rare disorder of gastrointestinal motility where coordinated contractions (peristalsis) in the intestinal tract become altered and inefficient. "
"GABA-transaminase deficiency"," brain disease (encephalopathy) that begins in infancy. Babies with this disorder have recurrent seizures (epilepsy), uncontrolled limb movements (choreoathetosis), exaggerated reflexes (hyperreflexia), weak muscle tone (hypotonia), and excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence)."
"Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome","Megacystis-microcolon-intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome (MMIHS) is a severe disorder affecting the muscles that line the bladder and intestines . It is characterized by impairment of the muscle contractions that move food through the digestive tract (peristalsis) and empty the bladder."
"Meier-Gorlin syndrome","Meier-Gorlin syndrome is a condition primarily characterized by short stature. It is considered a form of primordial dwarfism because the growth problems begin before birth (intrauterine growth retardation). After birth, affected individuals continue to grow at a slow rate."
"Menkes syndrome","Menkes syndrome is a disorder that affects copper levels in the body. It is characterized by sparse, kinky hair; failure to gain weight and grow at the expected rate (failure to thrive); and deterioration of the nervous system."
"Microcephalic primordial dwarfism","Microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type 1 (MOPD1) is a genetic condition that is mainly characterized by intrauterine and post-natal growth retardation; an abnormally small head size ( microcephaly ); abnormal bone growth (skeletal dysplasia); distinctive facial features; and brain anomalies."
"Motor neuropathy, distal","The distal hereditary motor neuropathies (dHMN) comprise a heterogeneous group of diseases that share the common feature of a length-dependent predominantly motor neuropathy. Many forms of dHMN have minor sensory abnormalities and/or a significant upper-motor-neuron component, and there is often an overlap with the axonal forms of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT2) and with juvenile forms of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hereditary spastic paraplegia. "
"Nephrotic syndrome","Nephrotic syndrome is a group of symptoms that indicate your kidneys are not working properly. These symptoms include. too much protein in your urine, called proteinuria. low levels of a protein called albumin in your blood, called hypoalbuminemia."
Neurodegeneration," disease is caused by the progressive loss of structure or function of neurons"
"Occipital horn syndrome","Occipital horn syndrome (OHS), formerly considered a variant of Ehlers Danlos syndrome, is an X-linked recessive mitochondrial and connective tissue disorder. It is caused by a deficiency in the transport of the essential mineral copper, associated with mutations in the ATP7A gene."
"Rett-like syndrome","Rett syndrome is characterized by seizures, motor abnormalities, abnormal hand movements, problems with language, features of autism and the tendency to lose skills throughout adulthood. The symptoms begin between 6 and 18 months of age."
"Severe intestinal pseudo-obstruction	","Symptoms of intestinal pseudo-obstruction may include abdominal pain, bloating, and nausea and vomiting. Intestinal pseudo-obstruction occurs when nerve or muscle problems slow or stop the movement of food, fluid, air, and waste through your intestines."
"Severe intestinal pseudo-obstruction","Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) is a rare, severe disease characterized by the failure of the intestinal tract to propel its contents which results in a clinical picture mimicking mechanical obstruction in the absence of any lesion occluding the gut."
"Visceral myopathy","Familial visceral myopathy is a rare hereditary myopathic degeneration of both gastrointestinal and urinary tracts that causes chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. It usually presents after the first decade of life with megaduodenum, megacystis and symptoms such as abdominal distension and/or pain, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, dysphagia, and/or urinary tract infections."
