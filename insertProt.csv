P22059,"Oxysterol-binding protein 1",807,"Lipid transporter involved in lipid countertransport between the Golgi complex and membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum: specifically exchanges sterol with phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P), delivering sterol to the Golgi in exchange for PI4P, which is degraded by the SAC1/SACM1L phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum",NM_002556
P52565,"Rho GDP-dissociation inhibitor 1",204,"Controls Rho proteins homeostasis. Regulates the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the Rho proteins by inhibiting the dissociation of GDP from them, and the subsequent binding of GTP to them. Retains Rho proteins such as CDC42, RAC1 and RHOA in an inactive cytosolic pool, regulating their stability and protecting them from degradation. Actively involved in the recycling and distribution of activated Rho GTPases in the cell.",NM_004309
P63267,"Actin, gamma-enteric smooth muscle",376,"Actins are highly conserved proteins that are involved in various types of cell motility and are ubiquitously expressed in all eukaryotic cells.",NM_001615
P80404,"4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase, mitochondrial",500,"Catalyzes the conversion of gamma-aminobutyrate and L-beta-aminoisobutyrate to succinate semialdehyde and methylmalonate semialdehyde, respectively. Can also convert delta-aminovalerate and beta-alanine.",ABAT-V1
Q04656,"Copper-transporting ATPase 1",1500,"ATP-driven copper (Cu+) ion pump that plays an important role in intracellular copper ion homeostasis",NM_000052
Q13415,"Origin recognition complex subunit 1",861,"Component of the origin recognition complex (ORC) that binds origins of replication. DNA-binding is ATP-dependent. The DNA sequences that define origins of replication have not been identified yet. ORC is required to assemble the pre-replication complex necessary to initiate DNA replication.",NM_004153
